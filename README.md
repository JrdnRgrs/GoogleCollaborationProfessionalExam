# GoogleCollaborationProfessionalExam

These are all the exams for the coursera courses to get the Goolge Collaboration Professional Certification.

This was curated using the coursera-dl tool. Then I took all the *_exam html files, and combined them with this: http://www.html-merge.com/

Ultimately I want to import these into a Google Forms, but I'm not sure how.
